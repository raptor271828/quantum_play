hmmm what are we doing here

What Ive done:
Shro_Time_Dpendant_2d
has class 2d domain which gives a good frameowrk for real space 1 particle schroidnger wavefunctions and associated operators

test.py plays around with this!
and dumps tons of output files in a directory called test

eigens.py gives a basis set and hamiltonian independant eignfunction finder, but preconditioning is not yet implimented (i tried but failed >:( to do in momentum space, then switched to real space so i could use my other hamiltonian) has plotting utilities for animating the visualization process

eignes_test loads domain parameters output from test.py then


TODO:
auralize eigenfrequencies (make pretty noises)

cleannn uppp

time dependant hamiltonians??

barriers/mazes??

make interactable and real time...
