hmmm what are we doing here

i want to make a 2d schrodinger equation solver for unbound states to show time evolution
    -FFT laplacian operator

bound states: find eignenfunctions with 2D 1-particle solver, born oppenhiemer appoximation?

2d alternative to nuclear well?

Angular momentum operator
